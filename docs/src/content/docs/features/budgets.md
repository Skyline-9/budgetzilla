description: Setting and tracking monthly spending limits.

Budgets help you set spending limits for each category and track your progress throughout the month.

## Creating a Budget

1. Go to the **Dashboard**
2. Find the budget section
3. Click **Set Budget** next to a category
4. Enter your monthly limit

## How Budgets Work

- Budgets are **monthly** — they reset at the start of each month
- Each category can have one budget
- Budget progress shows spending vs. limit
- Visual indicators show when you're approaching or over budget

## Budget Status

| Status | Indicator | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| On Track | Green | Under 75% of budget |
| Warning | Yellow | Between 75-100% of budget |
| Over Budget | Red | Exceeded the budget limit |

## Editing Budgets

Click on any budget to modify the amount. Changes take effect immediately.

## Removing Budgets

To stop tracking a budget:

1. Click on the budget
2. Clear the amount or click **Remove Budget**
3. The category will no longer show budget tracking

## Budget Tips

- **Start conservative** — It's easier to increase budgets than to stick to tight ones
- **Review monthly** — Adjust based on actual spending patterns
- **Focus on controllable expenses** — Budget for discretionary spending first
- **Don't budget everything** — Some categories (like rent) are fixed and don't need tracking

## Viewing Budget History

The dashboard shows current month by default. Use the date selector to view past months and compare your budgeting performance over time.
