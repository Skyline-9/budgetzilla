Categories help you organize and understand where your money goes.

## Default Categories

Budgetzilla comes with common categories pre-configured:

**Expenses:**
- Food & Dining
- Transportation
- Shopping
- Entertainment
- Bills & Utilities
- Health
- Other

**Income:**
- Salary
- Freelance
- Investments
- Other Income

## Creating Categories

1. Go to the **Categories** page
2. Click **+ Add Category**
3. Enter a name
4. Choose a color
5. Select type (Expense or Income)
6. Optionally set an icon

## Editing Categories

Click on any category to edit its:

- Name
- Color
- Icon
- Type (Expense/Income)

Changing a category will update all transactions using that category.

## Deleting Categories

When you delete a category:

1. You'll be prompted to reassign transactions
2. Choose a replacement category
3. All transactions will be moved to the new category
4. The original category is deleted

## Category Colors

Colors help quickly identify categories in charts and lists. Choose distinctive colors for your most-used categories.

## Tips for Categories

- **Keep it simple** — Too many categories makes tracking harder
- **Be consistent** — Use the same category for similar purchases
- **Review regularly** — Adjust categories as your spending patterns change
- **Use subcategories sparingly** — Budget keeps things flat for simplicity
