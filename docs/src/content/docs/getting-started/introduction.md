---

Budgetzilla is a **local-first** personal finance application that helps you track spending, manage budgets, and understand your financial habits — all while keeping your data completely private.

## Why Budgetzilla?

### Local-First Philosophy

Unlike traditional budgeting apps that store your sensitive financial data on remote servers, Budgetzilla keeps everything on your device:

- **Privacy**: Your financial data never leaves your browser
- **Speed**: No network latency — everything is instant
- **Offline**: Works without internet connection
- **Control**: Export your data anytime in standard formats

### Modern Technology

Budgetzilla is built with modern web technologies:

- **React 18** with TypeScript for a responsive UI
- **SQLite WASM** for robust local database storage
- **OPFS** (Origin Private File System) for persistent browser storage
- **Optional Google Drive sync** for backup when you want it

### Native macOS App

While Budgetzilla runs great in any modern browser, we also provide a native macOS app that:

- Runs as a standalone application
- Has native menus and keyboard shortcuts
- Stores data in the app's container for better persistence

## Key Features

- **Transaction tracking** with categories and tags
- **Budgetzilla management** with monthly allocations
- **Visual dashboard** with charts and trends
- **Fast search** (Cmd+K) across all transactions
- **Import/Export** for data portability
- **Dark mode** support

## Who Is This For?

Budgetzilla is ideal for:

- Privacy-conscious individuals who want control over their financial data
- Users who prefer local applications over cloud services
- Developers interested in local-first architecture
- Anyone looking for a simple, focused budgeting tool
